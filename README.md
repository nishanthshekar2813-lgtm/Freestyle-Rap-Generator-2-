# Freestyle-Rap-Generator-2-
The application, titled "FreestyleRapGUI 2," builds a main Frame window with input fields and buttons. The inputs include a TextField for the Rap Name, a TextField for a required Keyword, and a ComboBox to select a rap Style (Aggressive, Chill, Funny, Emotional). The generated rap is displayed in a non-editable TextArea in the center of the window.
